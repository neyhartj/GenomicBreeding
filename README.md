## Introduction

This package provides easy-to-use functions for conducting genomic
prediction. There are other packages that provide functions to solve
mixed models in the context of genomic selection, and this package
builds on some but in a way that is hopefully easier to use. Functions
include those for cross-validation, marker matrix filtering, etc.
