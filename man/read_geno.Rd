\title{Read in SNP marker genotype data}
\usage{
read_geno(
  filename,
  geno,
  ploidy = 2L,
  phased = FALSE,
  sep = ".",
  inbred = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{Name of CSV file with marker allele dosage}

\item{geno}{A data frame of marker allele dosages. If passed, \code{filename} is ignored.}

\item{ploidy}{The ploidy level e.g. 2, 4, 6, ..., etc.}

\item{phased}{If TRUE, the input genotype matrix is phased, with alleles coded as positive integers. The name of each
individual/clone column is the id and haplotype, concatenated by \code{sep}.}

\item{sep}{The haplotype concatenator; see \code{phased}.}

\item{inbred}{Logical. If unphased marker data is passed, should the function assume that all genotypes are inbred?}
}
\value{
Variable of class \code{\link{geno}}.
}
\description{
Read in SNP marker genotype data
}
\details{
The first columns of the file or geno object should be marker, chrom, cM (and optionally bp, if provided). Subsequent columns
contain the allele dosage for individuals/clones, coded 0,1,2. While fractional values are allowed for genomewide prediction,
these values are rounded when predicting the genetic variance within crosses.

\examples{
# Use data from the PopVar package
data("barley_geno", package = "PopVar")
data("cranberry_geno", package = "PopVar")
data("cranberry_geno_phased", package = "PopVar")

# Read in barley marker genotypes assuming no phasing and non-inbred lines.
geno_in <- read_geno(geno = barley_geno)

# Read in barley marker genotypes assuming completely inbred lines
geno_in <- read_geno(geno = barley_geno, inbred = TRUE)

# Read in cranberry marker genotype assuming no phasing
geno_in <- read_geno(geno = cranberry_geno)

# Read in cranberry phased haplotypes from Beagle
geno_in <- read_geno(geno = cranberry_geno_phased, phased = TRUE, sep = "_hap")
